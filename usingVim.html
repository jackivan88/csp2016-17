    <h1>Using Vim<br>
    </h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.vim.org/about.php">Vim</a> is one of the text
      editors that's installed on many Unix-based systems. It is
      mode-based, which seems unusual at first.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Checkpoint 1: VIM Adventures<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The first thing you should do is <a
        href="http://vim-adventures.com/">try out a game called VIM
        Adventures</a>. This introduces basic Vim commands, and
      especially teaches you to use the h, j, k, and l keys for
      navigating in Vim. Keep playing until you finish Level 3 before
      moving on to the next tutorial. You can complete the game later if
      you want.<br>

    <h2>Checkpoint 4: Vim Tutor</h2>
    <p>Now you're going to use Vim to learn about Vim. By now, you
      should be very familiar with the basic commands, and this will
      cover them again. But this time it will be in the actual Vim
      program. <a href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">Download the
        latest version of Vim for your operating system</a> from their
      website. Install it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Complete the tutorial before moving on.<br>
