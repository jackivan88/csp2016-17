    <h1>Using Vim<br>
    </h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.vim.org/about.php">Vim</a> is one of the text
      editors that's installed on many Unix-based systems. It is
      mode-based, which seems unusual at first.</p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId386669"></a>Checkpoint 1: VIM
      Adventures<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The first thing you should do is <a
        href="http://vim-adventures.com/">try out a game called VIM
        Adventures</a>. This introduces basic Vim commands, and
      especially teaches you to use the h, j, k, and l keys for
      navigating in Vim. Keep playing until you finish Level 3 before
      moving on to the next tutorial. You can complete the game later if
      you want.<br>

      Interactive Vim Tutorial</h2>
    <p><a href="http://openvim.com/">Go to openvim.com</a> and complete
      sections one through eighteen.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId355233"></a>Checkpoint 3:
      Installing Vim</h2>
    <p>Close all open programs other than Chrome. <a
        href="http://www.vim.org/download.php">Download and install the
        latest version of Vim for your operating system</a> from their
      website. Mac users can also install Vim using <a
        href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Then launch it. On Windows
      it is called gVim, and on macOS it is called MacVim, unless you
      installed it using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId487781"></a>Checkpoint 4: Vim
      Tutor</h2>
    <p>Now you're going to use Vim to learn about Vim. By now, you
      should be very familiar with the basic commands, and this will
      cover them again. But this time it will be in the actual Vim
      program. In Windows you can launch it by searching for "Vim tutor"
      and on macOS you can launch it by typing "vimtutor" in your
      terminal. Finish the entire tutorial. </p>
