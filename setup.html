    <p>You'll need to install certain programs for this class. Some <i>must</i>
      be installed, while others are only recommended. If you reset your
      computer, you are expected to reinstall the programs you need for
      the class. </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId754638"></a>Software</h2>
    <h3>Checkpoint 1: Student Software Pack</h3>
    <p>Install the standard student software pack if you haven't
      already. <a
        href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987">Make sure
        that Google Drive is set up</a> on your laptop so that your
      files sync to your computer.</p>

      this checkpoint.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>Checkpoint 2: Text Editor</h3>
    <p>Install a good text editor like <a
        href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++ for Windows</a>
      or <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">
        TextWrangler for Mac</a>. If you're looking for a challenge, <br>
      try installing Vim. It's tough to learn at first, but it's very
      powerful. If you already have a text editor (not a word processor)
      that you like to use, then you may do so as long as it can handle
      what you need to do for class. This article on <a
        href="https://idrh.ku.edu/text-editors-and-word-processors">the
        difference between word processors and text editors</a> might
      help you understand why you need a text editor. <a
        href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/%7Ecottrell/wp.html">This
        article on why text editors are better is much more entertaining</a>.</p>

    <h3>Checkpoint 4: KeePass</h3>
    <p>Install <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> so you don't
      lose passwords to important accounts. If you can't access an
      account or program because you forgot your password, you will
      receive a zero for the assignment.</p>
    <p>Once you install KeePass, set it up with a master password. Write
      down the master password on a piece of notebook paper. You will
      need to store this later for homework.</p>

    <h3>Checkpoint 6: Github</h3>
    <p>Go to Github and create an account. You must use your school
      email address. If you have a personal Github account, you can use
      it but you must change your account email to your school email
      address or create a new account using your school email address.</p>
    <p>Once you've created an account and logged in, open Git GUI on
      your computer and click on Help in the menu. Choose Show SSH Key.
      If you already have a key, copy it to your clipboard. If you
      don't, click Generate. You may leave the password blank if you
      prefer. Then copy it to your clipboard.<br>
