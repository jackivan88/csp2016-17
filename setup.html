      be installed, while others are only recommended. If you reset your
      computer, you are expected to reinstall the programs you need for

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId824138"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Student Software Pack</h3>
    <p>Install the standard student software pack if you haven't
      already. <a
        href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987">Make sure
        that Google Drive is set up</a> on your laptop so that your
      files sync to your computer.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId852342"></a>Checkpoint 2: Text
      Editor</h3>
    <p>Install a good text editor like <a
        href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++ for Windows</a>
      or <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">
        TextWrangler for Mac</a>. If you're looking for a challenge, <br>
      try installing Vim. It's tough to learn at first, but it's very
      powerful. If you already have a text editor (not a word processor)
      that you like to use, then you may do so as long as it can handle
      what you need to do for class. This article on <a
        href="https://idrh.ku.edu/text-editors-and-word-processors">the
        difference between word processors and text editors</a> might
      help you understand why you need a text editor. <a
        href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/%7Ecottrell/wp.html">This
        article on why text editors are better is much more entertaining</a>.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId878162"></a>Checkpoint 3: Git</h3>
    <p>Install <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. You can use the
      default settings.</p>
    <p>If you are using Windows, go to the Start Menu and search for Git
      Bash. Open it and type in the following commands, replacing the
      example email with your school email and the example name with
      your name. If you are using a Mac, open the Terminal and run it
      from there.<br>
    </p>
    <p><code>git config --global user.email "johndoe@seoulchristian.org"</code></p>
    <p><code>git config --global user.name "John Doe"</code><br>
    </p>
    <p>Close Git bash and install <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git



        LFS</a>. You can use the default settings. Then open Git Bash
      and type the following command.</p>
    <p><code>git lfs install</code></p>
    <p>Now if you need Git LFS for an assignment, you can use it.<br>
    </p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId226394"></a>Checkpoint 4:
      KeePass</h3>
    <p>Install <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> so you don't
      lose passwords to important accounts. If you're using a Mac, look
      for KeePassX. If you can't access an account or program because
      you forgot your password, you will receive a zero for the
      assignment.</p>
    <p>Once you install KeePass, create a new KeePass database and set
      it up with a master password. Write down the master password on a
      piece of notebook paper. You will need to store this later for
      homework.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId378711"></a>Checkpoint 5:
      Firefox Developer Edition</h3>
    <p>Install <a
        href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox
        Developer Edition</a> for web development.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId319327"></a>Checkpoint 6:
      Github</h3>
    <p>Go to <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and create an
      account. You must use your school email address. If you have a
      personal Github account, you can use it but you must change your
      account email to your school email address or create a new account
      using your school email address.</p>
    <p>Save your Github password in KeePass.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Once you've created an account and logged in, open Git GUI
      (Windows only) on your computer and click on Help in the menu.
      Choose <code>Show SSH Key</code>. If you already have a key, copy
      it to your clipboard. If you don't, click <code>Generate</code>.
      You may leave the password blank if you prefer. Then copy it to
      your clipboard.<br>
