    <p>You'll need to install certain programs for this class. Some <i>must</i> be installed, while others are only recommended. If you reset your computer, you are expected to reinstall the programs you need for the class. </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId754638"></a>Software</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Install the standard student software pack if you haven't already. <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2374987">Make
          sure that Google Drive is set up</a> on your laptop so that your files sync to your computer. </li>
        <li>Install a good text editor like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++ for Windows</a> or <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">
          TextWrangler for Mac</a>. If you're looking for a challenge, try installing Vim. It's tough to learn at first, but it's very powerful. If you already have a text editor (not a word processor) that you like to use, then you may do so as long as it can handle what you need to do for class. This article on <a href="https://idrh.ku.edu/text-editors-and-word-processors">the difference between word processors and text editors</a> might help you understand why you need a text editor. <a href="http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/%7Ecottrell/wp.html">This
          article on why text editors are better is much more
          entertaining</a>. </li>
        <li>Install <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. You can use the default settings. </li>
        <li>Install <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a> so you don't lose passwords to important accounts. If you can't access an account or program because you forgot your password, you will receive a zero for the assignment.</li>
        <li>Install <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox Developer Edition</a> for web development. </li>
