    <h1>Fade<br>
    </h1>
    <p>We're going to learn how to make an LED gradually fade on and
      off. We'll actually use two different methods. It's important for
      you to realize that there is almost always more than one way to
      solve a problem in computer science. Usually one of them is
      optimal, but not always.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId635864"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Connect Your Arduino<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Get your supplies and take out only the Arduino and the USB
      cable. Connect your Arduino to your laptop, open the Arduino IDE,
      and make sure the correct port is selected.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId32734"></a>Checkpoint 2: First
      Fade<br>
    </h2>
    <p>The first program uses the <a
        href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/For"><b>for</b>
        statement</a>. This type of statement is usually used to run the
      code inside repeatedly until the test condition is no longer true.
      Open a new sketch and delete the comments. Then add code to
      activate the serial connection when the Arduino turns on and set
      pin 9 to output. Then save the program as <i>forFade</i>. Add and
      commit your code to version control.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId749796"></a>Checkpoint 3: for<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Then add two <b>for</b> statements inside the <b>void loop()</b>
      section. A <b>for</b> statement consists of:</p>
    <p><samp>for (initialize; test; increment/decrement) {</samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>}</samp></p>
    <p>The initialization happens once, the test happens each time
      through the loop, and the <a
        href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Increment">increment
        or decrement</a> is executed if the test is true. The loop stops
      as soon as the test is false. The first <b>for</b> statement will
      gradually increase the brightness of the LED to the maximum value
      of 255, and the second will decrease the brightness of the LED to
      the minimum value of 0.</p>
    <p>The initialization of the first <b>for</b> statement is:</p>
    <p><code><samp>int lightValue = 0</samp></code></p>
    <p>The test for the first <b>for</b> statement is:</p>
    <p><code><samp>lightValue &lt;= 255</samp></code></p>
    <p>The loop increments the value of <b>lightValue</b> once each
      time:</p>
    <p><code>lightValue++</code></p>
    <p>Replace the placeholders with the code above. Once these are
      inserted, you're ready to add code inside the for statement that
      will run each time. First, you need to send the <b>lightValue</b>
      to pin 9, but instead of using <b><a
          href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/DigitalWrite">digitalWrite</a></b>,
      you will use <b><a
          href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AnalogWrite">analogWrite</a></b>.
      The first is binary: either on or off. The second has a range of
      values from 0 to 255. It looks like:</p>
    <p><samp>analogWrite(pin, value)</samp><br>
    </p>
    <p>Only some of the pins support analog output. Use <b>analogWrite</b>
      to send <b>lightValue</b> to pin 9. Then add code to output <b>lightValue</b>
      to the serial monitor as well. Then add a ten millisecond delay at
      the end of the loop.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Look at your board and identify the symbol that tells you which
      ones support analog.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId643261"></a>Checkpoint 4: And
      Back Down<br>
    </h2>
    The contents of the second <b>for</b> statement are identical, but
    the initialization, test, and <a
      href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Increment">increment/decrement</a>
    are different. Figure out how to reduce the brightness from a
    starting value of 255 down to 0.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId91058"></a>Checkpoint 5:
      Testing<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Set up your Arduino so that it is connected to the red external
      LED with a 1K resistor between the Arduino and the LED. Make sure
      your LED is wired into the right pin. Then upload your code and
      test it. You should see the light gradually increase and decrease
      in brightness. Confirm this with the serial monitor. If you're
      successful, then format, save, add, and commit your code.</p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId675089"></a>Checkpoint 6:
      Second Fade<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Open a new sketch and delete the comments. This time we're going
      to use the <b>if</b> statement and we will need only one loop
      instead of two. First, set two variables at the very beginning of
      the program, before the <b>void setup()</b> function:</p>
    <p><code>int lightValue = 0;</code><br>
      <code>int delta = 1;</code></p>
    <p>We are setting the initial value of <b>lightValue</b> to 0 and
      the value of <b>delta</b> (which means change) to 1. Then, add
      code to set pin 9 to output and activate the serial connection.
      Save the program as <i>ifFade</i> and then add and commit it to
      version control.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId372063"></a>Checkpoint 7: Add,
      Flip<br>
    </h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now, in the <b>void loop()</b> section, add:</p>
    <code>lightValue = lightValue + delta;</code><br>
    <code>if (lightValue &lt;= 0 || lightValue &gt;= 255) {</code><br>
    <code>&nbsp; delta = -delta;</code><br>
    <code>}</code><br>
    <p>Explain what you think this code does.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId574868"></a>Checkpoint 8:
      Finish and Test<br>
    </h2>
    Add code to the <b>void loop()</b> section to output <b>lightValue</b>
    to both the LED and the serial monitor, and add a ten millisecond
    delay. Then upload the code to your Arduino. If it works, then
    format, save, add, and commit it.<br>
    <p></p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId151306"></a>Checkpoint 9:
      Comment Your Code<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Go back and add comments to each line of code from both programs
      explaining what each does. Then save, add, and commit your code.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId941739"></a>Checkpoint 10:
      Clean<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Place your Arduino, USB cable, breadboard, wires, resistor, and
      LED inside your bag and place the bag on the back table. Then push
      your finished code to your remote repository. </p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId151306"></a>Checkpoint 11:
      Write</h2>
    <p>Write a short blog post summarizing what you accomplished in this
      lesson. At the end, write some ideas that you would like to try
      with your Arduino. Your post should be two paragraphs, three to
      five sentences each. Tell which version of the program you like
      more, and why.<br>
