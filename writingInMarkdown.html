    <h1>Writing in Markdown<br>
    </h1>
    <p> Markdown is a markup system originally developed by John Gruber.
      According to his website:<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers.
        Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read,
        easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally
        valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>
      <p>Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting
        syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts
        the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for
        details pertaining to Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try
        it out, right now, using the online Dingus.</p>
      <p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is
        to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a
        Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as
        plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags
        or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been
        influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single
        biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the
        format of plain text email.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Markdown is used by many developers and writers, and it's a tool
      you'll use throughout this year, especially in GitHub. You should
      keep your Markdown reference card handy while you complete this
      lesson.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId452151"></a>Checkpoint 2: txti<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Although you can use any text editor to write Markdown, not all
      editors can preview what it will look like when you're ready to
      print or publish. So we will use a web service that will let you
      see the results quickly so you can make changes and correct
      mistakes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Go to <a href="http://txti.es/">txti.es</a> in another tab. This
      website allows you to publish extremely simple pages online using
      Markdown. In the text box, type in the following text, including
      the blank lines:</p>
    <p><code># This is a heading</code><code><br>
      </code><code><br>
      </code><code>This is a paragraph. Paragraphs are awesome.</code><code><br>
      </code><code><br>
      </code><code>You can start a new paragraph by leaving a blank line
        between lines of text.</code><code><br>
      </code><code><br>
      </code><code>If you don't leave a blank line</code><code><br>
      </code><code>the next line will be a part of the same paragraph.</code></p>
    <p>Your screen should look like this when you are done:</p>
    <p align="center"><img alt=""
        src="images/firefox_2016-09-29_11-53-50.png" height="571"
        width="800"> </p>
    <p>Go ahead and press <b>Save and done</b>. On the next screen it
      will ask you for your email. Type in your school email address and
      click <b>Email the below info</b>. Then open the page you just
      created by clicking the viewing link.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId961275"></a>Checkpoint 3:
      Italics and Bold<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Go to the edit link for your page by adding <code>/edit</code>
      at the end of the URL and pressing Enter. Make the first sentence
      of the first paragraph italicized by putting underscores (the _
      character) on either side of it. Make the second sentence of the
      first paragraph bold by putting two asterisks (the * character) on
      either side of it. Scroll to the bottom of the page and put in
      your edit code that was emailed to you. Then press <b>Save and
        done</b>.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId467959"></a>Checkpoint 4:
      Lists</h2>
    <p>Go to the edit link for your page by adding <code>/edit</code>
      at the end of the URL and pressing Enter. Add an ordered list (a
      list that is numbered) of five items to your website. Remember to
      put the number at the very beginning of the line, followed by a
      period and a space. It's better to start each list item with a <code>1.&nbsp;</code>
      so that you can rearrange them later without having to change the
      numbers.</p>
    <p>Then create an unordered list (a list that uses bullet points) of
      five items to your website. Remember to start each line with an
      asterisk and a space. Scroll to the bottom of the page and put in
      your edit code that was emailed to you. Then press <b>Save and
        done</b>.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId621858"></a>Checkpoint 5:
      Blockquotes</h2>
    <p>Go to the edit link for your page by adding <code>/edit</code>
      at the end of the URL and pressing Enter. Whenever you quote text
      from another source in a web page, you should use the blockquote
      tag. In Markdown, we indicate the start of a blockquote with the
      &gt; symbol. Copy this paragraph into your page and add the &gt;
      symbol and a space at the beginning of the paragraph. Scroll to
      the bottom of the page and put in your edit code that was emailed
      to you. Then press <b>Save and done</b>.</p>
    <p><i>If the quote doesn't appear indented and you can see the &gt;
        symbol, that means there is a problem with txti, not your
        Markdown formatting. This isn't something you can fix, so you
        can move on to the next checkpoint.</i><br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId18556"></a>Checkpoint 6: Links
      and Images</h2>
    <p></p>
    <p>Go to the edit link for your page by adding <code>/edit</code>
      at the end of the URL and pressing Enter. To create a link to
      another page, you surround the text you want linked with [ and ]
      and the actual link with ( and ). Create a link to this page in
      your website.</p>
    <p>To add images, we use the same syntax as with links, except you
      put a ! in front of the [link text] to tell the computer it is an
      image, not a traditional link. Go ahead and copy the link to the
      picture in Checkpoint 2 and then insert it into your website.
      Scroll to the bottom of the page and put in your edit code that
      was emailed to you. Then press <b>Save and done</b>.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
