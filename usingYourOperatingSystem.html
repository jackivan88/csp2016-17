    <h1>Using Your Operating System<br>
    </h1>
    <p>Your computer is running either macOS or Windows. In this lesson
      you're going to learn some of the basic features of your operating
      system so that you can work more quickly and effectively.</p>
    <p>First, you need to know what operating system you're running, and
      which version of it. Almost all computers running macOS are
      manufactured by Apple, and all Apple computers have the signature
      Apple logo on them somewhere. However, Apple computers are capable
      of running other operating systems besides macOS. Always remember
      that hardware is not the same as software. Hardware is the
      machinery that the software runs on.</p>
    <p>If you look at the upper edge of your screen and see a menu bar
      with an apple at the far left edge, you're running macOS. If you
      look at the lower edge of the screen and see a square or circle
      divided into four parts, you're running Windows. However, there
      are many different versions of macOS and Windows, so move on to
      the appropriate section and follow the checkpoints to learn more
      about what your computer is running.</p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId641274"></a>macOS</h2>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId787600"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Which Version? </h3>
    <p>Click on the apple icon at the upper-left corner of your screen.
      Choose About This Mac and look for a version number underneath the
      name. That name and number is the version of macOS (formerly OS X)
      that you are running.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId922510"></a>Checkpoint 2: Lock
      and Unlock</h3>
    <p>By default, Apple computers don't have a quick way to lock the
      screen when you move away from your computer. However, you should
      know how to enable this so that your computer is always secure
      when you're not using it. Before you do anything, try pressing
      Control-Shift-Eject (if you have a CD drive) or
      Control-Shift-Power (if you do not have a CD drive) and see what
      happens.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Then, go to the Apple menu and choose System Preferences. Choose
      Security &amp; Privacy and look under the General tab. You should
      see a check box labeled Require password... Choose an interval and
      then close your System Preferences. If you did this correctly,
      then pressing Control-Shift-Eject or Control-Shift-Power should
      cause your screen to go black. When you move the cursor or hit a
      key, it should require you to enter your password to use your
      computer.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId121884"></a>Checkpoint 3:
      Sleep and Wake</h3>
    <p>Since you are using a laptop, there are multiple ways to make
      your Apple computer sleep. Sleep is just a term we use to describe
      computers that are in a low-power mode that allows them to be used
      quickly. When you press the power button on your phone to turn off
      the screen, it is in sleep mode.</p>
    <p>Go to the Apple menu and find the option labeled Sleep. Press it
      and see what happens. Then move the cursor or press a key to wake
      it back up. Then close the laptop, leave it for about five
      seconds, and open it back up. Which method would work on either a
      desktop or a laptop?</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId208589"></a>Checkpoint 4:
      Shutdown and Startup</h3>
    <p>To completely power down your laptop, go to the Apple menu and
      choose Shut Down. Your laptop should be completely powered off
      within a few seconds. Then how do you turn it back on?</p>
    <p>If your computer was completely frozen, meaning that it won't
      respond to you, you can force it to shut down by holding down the
      power button for several seconds. However, this is never a good
      idea if your computer isn't frozen. Always shut down the computer
      by choosing Shut Down from the Apple menu.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId188088"></a>
      Checkpoint 5: Restart</h3>
    <p>Now, go to the Apple menu and choose Restart. Your laptop should
      shut down and then start back up on its own without you doing
      anything.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId400980"></a>
      Checkpoint 6: What's Going On?</h3>
    <p>If your computer is running slowly or you are concerned there is
      a problem, you should check Activity Monitor. You can use this
      tool to see what is running on your computer as well as force
      programs that are frozen to quit. Click on the magnifying glass in
      the upper-right corner of the screen and see if you can find the
      Activity Monitor.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId743782"></a>Checkpoint 7: The
      Menubar</h3>
    <p>So far you've used the Apple menu and the search tool, called
      Spotlight. Click on each of the other icons (not the menus
      themselves) and see what each one does. Be prepared to explain
      what they do. If you're not sure, look online and see if you can
      find out.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId778903"></a>
      Checkpoint 8: Common Shortcuts</h3>
    <p>Your Apple computer has several modifier keys. These keys don't
      do anything on their own (you can try pressing one to see this)
      but when they are pressed along with other keys they allow you to
      perform different tasks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Command ⌘</li>
      <li>Shift ⇧</li>
      <li>Option ⌥</li>
      <li>Control ⌃</li>
      <li>Caps Lock ⇪</li>
      <li>Fn</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should know these modifier keys and be able to press the
      right one when asked. Take a look at the first section of <a
        href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236">Apple's list of
        Mac keyboard shortcuts</a> (titled <i>Cut, copy, paste, and
        other common shortcuts</i>) and try each one of them. Once
      you're done you will be asked to try several at random. Once you
      can do at least five from memory you'll be able to move on.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId286301"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Which Version? </h3>
    <p>First, press Windows-X on your keyboard. A menu should appear in
      the lower-left corner of your screen. Choose System. This will
      bring up your computer's information. See if you can find the name
      of your operating system. If nothing happened when you pressed
      Windows-X, then click the Windows icon at the lower-left corner of
      your screen. On the right-hand side of the Start Menu you'll see
      Computer as one of the choices. Right-click on it and select
      Properties. You should be able to see the name of your operating
      system.<br>
