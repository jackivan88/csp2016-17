    <h1>Using the Command Line</h1>
    <p>Most of the time we are using computers and other electronic
      devices, we are using what is known as a graphical user interface,
      or GUI. These interfaces are a layer between the user - you - and
      the machine. Before graphical user interfaces were common, most
      machines were run using the command line. All three major
      operating systems - Linux, Windows, and macOS - have a command
      line, even though you don't have to use them. We are going to
      practice using PowerShell and Bash. If you are using a Mac, you
      will need to borrow a Windows computer to complete this
      assignment. We will use our PocketCHIPs for the Bash practice.</p>
    <p>This is a much longer lesson, so don't get frustrated if it takes
      you longer than you think it should.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>PowerShell</h2>
    <p>You must use a Windows computer for this part of the exercise, so
      please let Mr. Olinda know if you need to borrow a school
      computer. Open the Start Menu and search for <code>Windows
        PowerShell</code>. It should be the first result, but make sure
      you do not choose any options ending in ISE. You should see a
      window that looks like this:</p>

          width="800"></p>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Yours should show your user name instead of "John Olinda,"
          but other than that it should appear identical.</p>
        <h3>pwd</h3>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <h3>cd</h3>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <h3>mkdir</h3>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>ls</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>rmdir</p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <p>pushd, popd</p>
