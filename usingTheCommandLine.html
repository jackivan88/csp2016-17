    <h1>Using the Command Line</h1>
    <p>Most of the time we are using computers and other electronic
      devices, we are using what is known as a graphical user interface,
      or GUI. These interfaces are a layer between the user - you - and
      the machine. Before graphical user interfaces were common, most
      machines were run using the command line. All three major
      operating systems - Linux, Windows, and macOS - have a command
      line, even though you don't have to use them. We are going to
      practice using PowerShell and Bash. If you are using a Mac, you
      will need to borrow a Windows computer to complete this
      assignment. We will use our PocketCHIPs for the Bash practice.</p>
    <p>This is a much longer lesson, so don't get frustrated if it takes
      you longer than you think it should.</p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId844421"></a>PowerShell</h2>
    <p>You must use a Windows computer for this part of the exercise, so
      please let Mr. Olinda know if you need to borrow a school
      computer. Open the Start Menu and search for <code>Windows
        PowerShell</code>. It should be the first result, but make sure
      you do not choose any options ending in ISE. You should see a
      window that looks like this:</p>
    <div align="center">
      <p><img alt="Windows PowerShell Interface" title="Windows
          PowerShell Interface"
          src="images/powershell_2016-09-03_12-46-57.png" height="561"
          width="800"></p>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Yours should show your user name instead of "John Olinda,"
          but other than that it should appear identical. I'll refer to
          the "prompt" throughout this lesson and throughout the course.
          The PowerShell prompt ends in the &gt; symbol and indicates
          that you can type commands. Sometimes I will ask you to clear
          your terminal by typing <code>clear</code> and pressing
          Enter. This will erase the content of the command line, but it
          will not undo previous commands.<br>
        </p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId390239"></a>Checkpoint 1:
          pwd</h3>
        <p>This command is an abbreviation for "print working directory.
          This command shows you what directory (folder) you're in,
          which can be helpful if you are lost. Before you do anything
          else, just type <code>pwd</code> at the prompt and press
          Enter. Do this three times.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId456761"></a>Checkpoint 2:
          cd</h3>
        <p>This command is an abbreviation for "change directory." It
          allows you to move from one directory (folder) to another in
          the command line. It can also reset your working directory to
          your home directory, which can be much faster than changing
          directories one level at a time.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cd</code> and press Enter. Notice that nothing
          changed. This is because you just told the computer to change
          to the current directory.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cd Downloads</code> and press Enter. Check to see
          if your prompt now includes the Downloads folder just before
          the &gt; symbol. Now, any commands you execute will run in
          this directory (folder) instead of your home directory.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cd ..</code> and press Enter. Check to see what
          your current working directory is. It should be your home
          directory. If you're not sure, just type <code>pwd</code> and
          press Enter to check. If you went down another directory, you
          could type <code>cd ../..</code> to go back up twice with one
          command. We will practice this in the next checkpoint.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cd Mu</code> and press Tab. PowerShell should
          fill in the missing letters and show <code>cd .\Music\</code>
          instead. Now press Enter. When you're using the command line,
          you can press Tab to autocomplete the command, directory, or
          file that you are working on instead of typing the whole
          command.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Next, type <code>cd ~</code> and notice that you're back in
          your home directory.</p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId113707"></a>Checkpoint 3:
          mkdir</h3>
        <p>The mkdir command creates a new directory inside your working
          directory. You should be in your home directory. If not, press
          cd ~ to go there. Then type mkdir test and press Enter to
          create a directory called "test" inside your home directory.
          Then type cd test and press Enter to go down into the
          directory you just created.</p>
        <p>Type cd anotherTest and press Enter to create another
          directory inside the "test" directory. Then type cd
          anotherTest and press Enter to go down into this new
          directory.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId625745"></a>Bash</h2>
    <p>You must use a PocketCHIP for this part of the exercise, so
      please ask for yours. Open the Terminal. You should see a black
      screen that says <code>chip@chip:~$</code> and has a blinking
      cursor. I'll refer to the "prompt" throughout this lesson and
      throughout the course. The Bash prompt ends in the $ symbol and
      indicates that you can type commands. Sometimes I will ask you to
      clear your terminal by typing <code>clear</code> and pressing
      Enter. This will erase the content of the command line, but it
      will not undo previous commands.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId799682"></a>pwd</h3>
    <p>This command is an abbreviation for "print working directory.
      This command shows you what directory (folder) you're in, which
      can be helpful if you are lost. Before you do anything else, just
      type <code>pwd</code> at the prompt and press Enter. Do this
      three times.<br>

    <p>
    </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId643106"></a>cd</h3>
    <p>This command is an abbreviation for "change directory." It allows
      you to move from one directory (folder) to another in the command
      line. It can also reset your working directory to your home
      directory, which can be much faster than changing directories one
      level at a time.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd</code> and press Enter. Notice that nothing
      changed. This is because you just told the computer to change to
      the current directory.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd Downloads</code> and press Enter. Check to see if
