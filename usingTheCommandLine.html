    <h1>Using the Command Line</h1>
    <p>Most of the time we are using computers and other electronic
      devices, we are using what is known as a graphical user interface,
      or GUI. These interfaces are a layer between the user - you - and
      the machine. Before graphical user interfaces were common, most
      machines were run using the command line. All three major
      operating systems - Linux, Windows, and macOS - have a command
      line, even though you don't have to use them. We are going to
      practice using PowerShell and Bash. If you are using a Mac, you
      will need to borrow a Windows computer to complete this
      assignment. We will use our PocketCHIPs for the Bash practice.</p>
    <p>This is a much longer lesson, so don't get frustrated if it takes
      you longer than you think it should.</p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId844421"></a>PowerShell</h2>
    <p>You must use a Windows computer for this part of the exercise, so
      please let Mr. Olinda know if you need to borrow a school
      computer. Open the Start Menu and search for <code>Windows
        PowerShell</code>. It should be the first result, but make sure
      you do not choose any options ending in ISE. You should see a
      window that looks like this:</p>
    <div align="center">
      <p><img alt="Windows PowerShell Interface" title="Windows
          PowerShell Interface"
          src="images/powershell_2016-09-03_12-46-57.png" height="561"
          width="800"></p>
      <div align="left">
        <p>Yours should show your user name instead of "John Olinda,"
          but other than that it should appear identical. I'll refer to
          the "prompt" throughout this lesson and throughout the course.
          The PowerShell prompt ends in the &gt; symbol and indicates
          that you can type commands. Sometimes I will ask you to clear
          your terminal by typing <code>clear</code> and pressing
          Enter. This will erase the content of the command line, but it
          will not undo previous commands.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId390239"></a>Checkpoint 1:
          pwd</h3>
        <p>This command is an abbreviation for "print working directory.
          This command shows you what directory (folder) you're in,
          which can be helpful if you are lost. Before you do anything
          else, just type <code>pwd</code> at the prompt and press
          Enter. Do this three times.</p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId456761"></a>Checkpoint 2:
          cd</h3>
        <p>This command is an abbreviation for "change directory." It
          allows you to move from one directory (folder) to another in
          the command line. It can also reset your working directory to
          your home directory, which can be much faster than changing
          directories one level at a time.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cd</code> and press Enter. Notice that nothing
          changed. This is because you just told the computer to change
          to the current directory.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cd Downloads</code> and press Enter. Check to see
          if your prompt now includes the Downloads folder just before
          the &gt; symbol. Now, any commands you execute will run in
          this directory (folder) instead of your home directory.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cd ..</code> and press Enter. Check to see what
          your current working directory is. It should be your home
          directory. If you're not sure, just type <code>pwd</code> and
          press Enter to check. If you went down another directory, you
          could type <code>cd ../..</code> to go back up twice with one
          command. We will practice this in the next checkpoint.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cd Mu</code> and press Tab. PowerShell should
          fill in the missing letters and show <code>cd .\Music\</code>
          instead. Now press Enter. When you're using the command line,
          you can press Tab to autocomplete the command, directory, or
          file that you are working on instead of typing the whole
          command.</p>
        <p>Next, type <code>cd ~</code> and notice that you're back in
          your home directory.</p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId113707"></a>Checkpoint 3:
          mkdir</h3>
        <p>This command creates a new directory inside your working
          directory. You should be in your home directory. If not, type
          <code>cd ~</code> and press Enter to go there. Then type <code>mkdir




            test</code> and press Enter to create a directory called
          "test" inside your home directory. Then type <code>cd test</code>
          and press Enter to go down into the directory you just
          created.</p>
        <p>Type <code>mkdir anotherTest</code> and press Enter to
          create another directory inside the "test" directory. Then
          type <code>cd anotherTest</code> and press Enter to go down
          into this new directory.</p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId175105"></a>Checkpoint 4:
          ls</h3>
        <p>This command lists the files and directories inside the
          current working directory. Type <code>cd ~</code> and press
          Enter to go back to your home directory. Then type <code>ls</code>
          and press Enter to see what's inside the directory.</p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId960713"></a>Checkpoint 5:
          rmdir</h3>
        <p>This command removes directories. Type <code>cd ~</code> and
          press Enter to return to your home directory. Press Windows-E
          and go to your home directory so you can see the changes you
          make in PowerShell reflected in Windows Explorer. Then
          navigate down to the "test" directory. Type <code>rmdir
            anotherTest</code> and press Enter to delete the
          "anotherTest" directory and then use <code>ls</code> to make
          sure it has been deleted. Go back to your home directory and
          delete the "test" directory. Use <code>ls</code> to make sure
          you have removed it. When you check your home directory in
          Windows Explorer you should see that both directories are
          gone.</p>
        <p>Now, type <code>mkdir -p test/anotherTest</code> and press
          Enter. The <code>-p</code> is what we call a flag and it
          allows us to modify commands to do something slightly
          different. In this case, the <code>-p</code> flag allows us
          to create two directories, one inside the other, at the same
          time. Now type <code>rmdir test</code> and see what happens.
          <br>
        </p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId678629"></a>Checkpoint 6:
          pushd, popd</h3>
        <p>These two commands allow you to quickly switch between
          different directories. It works a little differently in
          PowerShell than it will in Bash. <br>
        </p>
        <p>First, type <code>mkdir -p test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code>
          and press Enter. Then type <code>pushd
            test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code> and see what happens.
          Confirm that you're in the "yetAnotherTest" directory with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
        <p>Then type <code>popd</code> and press Enter. Now where are
          you? Confirm this with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
        <p>Use <code>ls</code> and <code>pushd</code> to move to
          another directory and then use <code>popd</code> to move
          back. Try this at least three more times using different
          directories. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId513639"></a>Checkpoint 7:
          New-Item</h3>
        <p>This command allows you to create new files. First, use <code>cd</code>
          to move to the "yetAnotherTest" directory. Once you get there,
          type <code>New-Item test.txt</code> and press Enter. Confirm
          you created a new file with <code>ls</code>.</p>
        <p>Then go back to your home directory using <code>cd</code>
          and type <code>New-Item
            test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest/hello.txt</code> and press
          Enter. Then confirm you created a new file by typing <code>ls
            test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest/</code> and pressing Enter.
          You just created a file in a directory below your current
          working directory without actually moving there. Then you
          listed the contents of that directory without moving. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId740790"></a>Checkpoint 8:
          cp</h3>
        <p>This command allows you to copy files and directories from
          one place to another as well as within the same directory.
          Files can be copied exactly or renamed when copied.</p>
        <p>Move to the "yetAnotherTest" directory. Type <code>cp
            hello.txt howdy.txt</code> and press Enter. Then use <code>ls</code>
          to see if you now have three files - test.txt, hello.txt, and
          howdy.txt - in the directory. You just copied the file and
          renamed it at the same time.</p>
        <p>Type <code>mkdir pleaseStop</code> and press Enter. Then
          type <code>cp hello.txt pleaseStop/</code> and press Enter.
          Now when you use <code>ls</code> you should see a new
          directory inside "yetAnotherTest".<br>
        </p>
        <p>Type <code>cp -r pleaseStop really</code> and press Enter.
          Then use <code>ls</code> to make sure that you can see the
          "really" directory. You just copied a directory and its
          contents to a new directory. The <code>-r</code> flag stands
          for "recurse" which affects the directory and all of its
          contents. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId851765"></a>Checkpoint 9:
          mv</h3>
        <p>This command is similar to <code>cp</code> except that
          instead of copying the file, it moves the file to a new
          location. However, just like <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code>
          can also rename files at the same time. In fact, most of the
          time you will use this command to rename files, not actually
          move them to a new place. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Make sure you are in the "yetAnotherTest" directory and type
          <code>mv test.txt whenWillThisEnd.txt</code> and press Enter.
          Then use <code>ls</code> to confirm that test.txt is now
          called whenWillThisEnd.txt instead.</p>
        <p>Now type <code>mv really yesReally</code> and press Enter.
          You can use <code>ls</code> to make sure you've renamed the
          directory correctly.</p>
        <p>Now use <code>mv</code> to rename whenWillThisEnd.txt and
          "yesReally" back to their original names. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId275220"></a>Checkpoint 10:
          more</h3>
        <p>This command is used to display the contents of a text file,
          especially files that are too long to fit into your terminal
          window.</p>
        <p><a href="loremIpsum.txt">Download loremIpsum.txt</a> and save
          it to your Downloads folder. Then use <code>cp</code> to
          create a copy in the "yetAnotherTest" directory.</p>
        <p>Then type <code>more loremIpsum.txt</code> and notice that
          the whole file is displayed in your terminal window. If the
          file was too long you could use the space bar to display the
          next section until you had seen the whole file. This is called
          paging. <br>
        </p>
        <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
          this checkpoint.</p>
        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId236161"></a>Checkpoint 11:
          cat</h3>
        <p>Unlike the last command, this one streams the file to your
          terminal without any paging. But you can also stream multiple
          files to your terminal. First, open "yetAnotherTest" in
          Windows Explorer and add some text to each text file besides
          loremIpsum.txt using your text editor. Save each file and then
          move on.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cat loremIpsum.txt</code> and press Enter.</p>
        <p>Type <code>cat loremIpsum.txt hello.txt test.txt</code> and
          press Enter. What happened? Try just typing <code>cat</code>
          and then pressing Enter and entering the files individually.
          Then try the command with the text files in a different order.</p>
        <p>Can you stream the same file more than once in the same
          command? What happens if the output is too long for your
          terminal window? <br>

        <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId736782"></a>Checkpoint 12:
          rm</h3>
        <p>Now we're going to clean up our files and directories from
          this lesson using the <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code>
          commands.</p>
        <p>Make sure you're in the "yetAnotherTest" directory. Then type
          <code>rm loremIpsum.txt</code> and press Enter. Use <code>ls</code>
          to see if the file is gone. Then use rm to delete all the
          other files in the directory.</p>
        <p>Now try to use <code>rmdir</code> to delete the "pleaseStop"
          and "really" directories. Does it work? In Bash you will get
          an error, but in PowerShell you are able to decide what to do
          with directories that aren't empty.</p>
        <p>Now use <code>cd</code> to go to your home directory. Then
          type <code>rm -r test</code> in order to delete the whole
          directory, including its contents.</p>
        <p>Both commands can delete directories and files, but which one
          do you use to delete files in the working directory? You
          should always use <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code>
          very carefully since it's easy to damage your system by
          accidentally deleting files. <br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId625745"></a>Bash</h2>
    <p>You must use a PocketCHIP for this part of the exercise, so
      please ask for yours. Open the Terminal. You should see a black
      screen that says <code>chip@chip:~$</code> and has a blinking
      cursor. I'll refer to the "prompt" throughout this lesson and
      throughout the course. The Bash prompt ends in the $ symbol and
      indicates that you can type commands. Sometimes I will ask you to
      clear your terminal by typing <code>clear</code> and pressing
      Enter. This will erase the content of the command line, but it
      will not undo previous commands.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId643106"></a>Checkpoint 15: cd</h3>
    <p>This command is an abbreviation for "change directory." It allows
      you to move from one directory (folder) to another in the command
      line. It can also reset your working directory to your home
      directory, which can be much faster than changing directories one
      level at a time.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd</code> and press Enter. Notice that nothing

      practice this in the next checkpoint.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cd Mu</code> and press Tab. Bash should fill in the

      press Enter. When you're using the command line, you can press Tab
      to autocomplete the command, directory, or file that you are
      working on instead of typing the whole </p>
    <p>Next, type <code>cd ~</code> and notice that you're back in your
      home directory.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId198645"></a>Checkpoint 16:
      mkdir</h3>
    <p>This command creates a new directory inside your working
      directory. You should be in your home directory. If not, type <code>cd




        ~</code> and press Enter to go there. Then type <code>mkdir
        test</code> and press Enter to create a directory called "test"
      inside your home directory. Then type <code>cd test</code> and
      press Enter to go down into the directory you just created.</p>
    <p>Type <code>mkdir anotherTest</code> and press Enter to create
      another directory inside the "test" directory. Then type <code>cd
        anotherTest</code> and press Enter to go down into this new
      directory.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId297610"></a>Checkpoint 17: ls</h3>
    <p>This command lists the files and directories inside the current
      working directory. Type <code>cd ~</code> and press Enter to go
      back to your home directory. Then type <code>ls</code> and press
      Enter to see what's inside the directory.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId254558"></a>Checkpoint 18:
      rmdir</h3>
    <p>This command removes directories. Type <code>cd ~</code> and
      press Enter to return to your home directory. Then navigate down
      to the "test" directory. Type <code>rmdir anotherTest</code> and
      press Enter to delete the "anotherTest" directory and then use <code>ls</code>
      to make sure it has been deleted. Go back to your home directory
      and delete the "test" directory. Use <code>ls</code> to make sure
      you have removed it. When you check your home directory in the
      file browser you should see that both directories are gone.</p>
    <p>Now, type <code>mkdir -p test/anotherTest</code> and press
      Enter. The <code>-p</code> is what we call a flag and it allows
      us to modify commands to do something slightly different. In this
      case, the <code>-p</code> flag allows us to create two
      directories, one inside the other, at the same time. Now type <code>rmdir



        test</code> and see what happens.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId381126"></a>Checkpoint 19:
      pushd, popd</h3>
    <p>These two commands allow you to quickly switch between different
      directories. It works a little differently in Bash than in
      PowerShell. <br>
    </p>
    <p>First, type <code>mkdir -p test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code>
      and press Enter. Then type <code>pushd
        test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code> and see what happens.
      Confirm that you're in the "yetAnotherTest" directory with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
    <p>Then type <code>popd</code> and press Enter. Now where are you?
      Confirm this with <code>pwd</code>.</p>
    <p>Use <code>ls</code> and <code>pushd</code> to move to another
      directory and then use <code>popd</code> to move back. Try this
      at least three more times using different directories.</p>
    <p>Now, type <code>cd ~</code> and press Enter. Then type <code>pushd



        test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest</code> and press Enter. Navigate
      to any other directory besides "test" and then type <code>pushd</code>
      and press Enter.</p>
    <p>When you run a command all by itself, you're running it without
      any arguments. What happened when you ran <code>pushd</code>
      without any arguments? <br>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId296991"></a>Checkpoint 20:
      touch</h3>
    <p>This command allows you to create new files. First, use <code>cd</code>
      to move to the "yetAnotherTest" directory. Once you get there,
      type <code>touch test.txt</code> and press Enter. Confirm you
      created a new file with <code>ls</code>.</p>
    <p>Then go back to your home directory using <code>cd</code> and
      type <code>touch test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest/hello.txt</code>
      and press Enter. Then confirm you created a new file by typing <code>ls



        test/anotherTest/yetAnotherTest/</code> and pressing Enter. You
      just created a file in a directory below your current working
      directory without actually moving there. Then you listed the
      contents of that directory without moving.</p>

    <p> </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId947988"></a>Checkpoint 21: cp</h3>
    <p>This command allows you to copy files and directories from one
      place to another as well as within the same directory. Files can
      be copied exactly or renamed when copied.</p>
    <p>Move to the "yetAnotherTest" directory. Type <code>cp hello.txt
        howdy.txt</code> and press Enter. Then use <code>ls</code> to
      see if you now have three files - test.txt, hello.txt, and
      howdy.txt - in the directory. You just copied the file and renamed
      it at the same time.</p>
    <p>Type <code>mkdir pleaseStop</code> and press Enter. Then type <code>cp


        hello.txt pleaseStop/</code> and press Enter. Now when you use <code>ls</code>
      you should see a new directory inside "yetAnotherTest".</p>
    <p>Type <code>cp -r pleaseStop really</code> and press Enter. Then
      use <code>ls</code> to make sure that you can see the "really"
      directory. You just copied a directory and its contents to a new
      directory. The <code>-r</code> flag stands for "recurse" which
      affects the directory and all of its contents.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId319241"></a>Checkpoint 22: mv</h3>
    <p>This command is similar to <code>cp</code> except that instead
      of copying the file, it moves the file to a new location. However,
      just like <code>cp</code>, <code>mv</code> can also rename files
      at the same time. In fact, most of the time you will use this
      command to rename files, not actually move them to a new place. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Make sure you are in the "yetAnotherTest" directory and type <code>mv



        test.txt whenWillThisEnd.txt</code> and press Enter. Then use <code>ls</code>
      to confirm that test.txt is now called whenWillThisEnd.txt
      instead.</p>
    <p>Now type <code>mv really yesReally</code> and press Enter. You
      can use <code>ls</code> to make sure you've renamed the directory
      correctly.</p>
    <p>Now use <code>mv</code> to rename whenWillThisEnd.txt and
      "yesReally" back to their original names.</p>

    <p> </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId73089"></a>Checkpoint 23: less</h3>
    <p>This command is used to display the contents of a text file,
      especially files that are too long to fit into your terminal
      window.</p>
    <p>Use cd to move to the "yetAnotherTest" directory. Then type <code>curl


        -O</code> and the <a href="loremIpsum.txt">URL (link) of the
        loremIpsum.txt file</a> to download the file to the working
      directory.</p>
    <p>Then type <code>less loremIpsum.txt</code> and notice that the
      whole file is too large to display in your terminal window. Use
      the space bar to display the next section until you have seen the
      whole file. This is called paging.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId456131"></a>Checkpoint 24: cat</h3>
    <p>Unlike the last command, this one streams the file to your
      terminal without any paging. But you can also stream multiple
      files to your terminal. First, press the Home button and open
      "yetAnotherTest" in the Browse Files application and add some text
      to each text file besides loremIpsum.txt using your text editor.
      Save each file and then move on.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cat loremIpsum.txt</code> and press Enter.</p>
    <p>Type <code>cat loremIpsum.txt hello.txt test.txt</code> and
      press Enter. Then try the command with the text files in a
      different order.</p>
    <p>Can you stream the same file more than once in the same command?
      What happens if the output is too long for your terminal window?</p>
    <p></p>

    <p> </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId368437"></a>Checkpoint 25: rm</h3>
    <p>Now we're going to clean up our files and directories from this
      lesson using the <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code>
      commands.</p>
    <p>Make sure you're in the "yetAnotherTest" directory. Then type <code>rm
        loremIpsum.txt</code> and press Enter. Use <code>ls</code> to
      see if the file is gone. Then use rm to delete all the other files
      in the directory.</p>
    <p>Now try to use <code>rmdir</code> to delete the "pleaseStop" and
      "really" directories. Does it work? In Bash you will get an error,
      but in PowerShell you are able to decide what to do with
      directories that aren't empty.</p>
    <p>Now use <code>cd</code> to go to your home directory. Then type
      <code>rm -rf test</code> in order to delete the whole directory,
      including its contents. The <code>-f</code> flag means "force"
      which deletes the directory even if there are things inside it. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Both commands can delete directories and files, but which one do
      you use to delete files in the working directory? You should
      always use <code>rm</code> and <code>rmdir</code> very carefully
      since it's easy to damage your system by accidentally deleting
      files.</p>
