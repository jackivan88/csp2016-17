    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId594311"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Launching Nano<br>
    </h2>
    <p>There are three ways to launch Nano. The first is launching it
      with only the nano command. The second is launching it and
      simultaneously creating a new file. The third is launching it and
      editing an existing file.</p>
    <p>Open the terminal. Type <code>nano</code> without any arguments
      or flags and press Enter. You should see this:</p>
    <img alt="" title="What you should see when you launch nano without
      any arguments." src="images/chrome_2016-09-25_16-03-30.png"
      height="485" width="800"><br>
    <p>Close Nano by pressing Control-X. Now, type <code>nano foo.md</code>
      and press Enter. You should see this:</p>
    <img alt="" title="This is what you should see when you launch Nano
      with a new file argument."
      src="images/chrome_2016-09-25_16-09-29.png" height="485"
      width="800">
    <p>You can see at the top of the terminal that the file name is
      listed. Type in a sentence or two and then close Nano by pressing
      Control-X. This time, Nano will ask you to confirm your changes by
      pressing Y, or discard them by pressing N. You can cancel by
      pressing Control-C. Save your changes and confirm the filename by
      pressing Enter.</p>
    <p>Now type <code>nano foo.md</code> and press Enter. You should
      see the same file again. Add a new line at the bottom of the file
      and type I've completed Checkpoint 1. The close the file by
      pressing Control-X. Press Y, but this time change the name of the
      file to <code>checkpoint1.md</code> before you press Enter.</p>
    <p>Stream the contents of the new file to your terminal using <code>cat</code>
      and then raise your hand.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId975744"></a>Checkpoint 2:
      Saving</h2>
    <p>Open <code>foo.md</code> in nano and delete all the text inside.
      Then press Control-O to save the file without closing it. If
      you've done this correctly, your screen should look like this:</p>
    <img alt="" title="What you should see if you've saved the file
      correctly." src="images/chrome_2016-09-25_18-24-59.png"
      height="485" width="800">
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId786924"></a>Checkpoint 3: Read
      File<br>
    </h2>
    <p>You should still have <code>foo.md</code> open from the last
      checkpoint. If not, open it now. Then press Control-R to read
      another file and insert it into the current file. Type in <code>checkpoint1.md</code>
      when it prompts you and press Enter. Now <code>foo.md</code>
      contains the exact contents of <code>checkpoint1.md</code>.</p>
    <img alt="" title="You should see something similar after you read
      the contents of checkpoint1.md into foo.md."

    <p>What happens if you run this command on a file that's not empty?
      Go ahead and exit Nano, and be sure to save your changes.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId912231"></a>Checkpoint 4:
      Getting Help<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Open Nano and press Control-G. This takes you to the manual for
      the program if you ever need to reference it while you're working.
      Skim through the whole file before moving on.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId60068"></a>Checkpoint 5: Copy,
      Cut, and Paste</h2>
    <p>Type the following, including blank lines, into a new file called
      <code>checkpoint5.md</code>:<br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/chrome_2016-09-25_19-00-05.png" height="485"
      width="800">
    <p>Now, move your cursor to the beginning of one of the numbered
      lines using the arrow keys. Press Control-K to cut the line. Then
      move your cursor somewhere else in the list and press Control-U to
      uncut (paste) the text in. Try this in other places until you're
      comfortable, and then move everything back to the original layout.</p>
    <p>Then press Alt-A (Alt is the Meta key in Nano) to start
      highlighting, and then use the arrow keys to move around and
      highlight text. Then press Alt-6 to copy the highlighted text. Go
      ahead and paste it somewhere else. Then remove the extra text
      using Control-K until the file looks like the original. Exit and
      save.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId205644"></a>Checkpoint 6: Find
      and Replace</h2>
    <p>Open a new file in nano called checkpoint6.md and use Control-R
      to read the contents of checkpoint5.md into it. Then save the
      file. Now, press Control-W and find the word "rice" in the file.
      You'll notice that once you press Enter the cursor moves to the
      beginning of the word you searched for. Try this with several
      different words.</p>
    <p>Now use Control-\ to search for a word and then replace it. In
      this case, we will search for the word "Rice" and replace it with
      the words "Brown rice". Try doing this with several other words.</p>
    <p>Now do a search for the word "Here" and replace it with "There".
      But this time, instead of just confirming the change, we want to
      press A to change all occurrences of "Here" at the same time.</p>

      width="800">
    <p>Notice that your last search is saved every time you search, so
      you can just press enter to do the same search again. Then save
      and exit.<br>
    </p>

    <p><strong>Now that you have tried the basics of Nano and Vim, you
        should be prepared to handle working with text on almost any
        Linux or Unix machine, even if it doesn't come with a graphical
        user interface. Turn in your checkpoint sheet to the assignment
        basket once it is completely signed. You may now work on stretch
        projects.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
