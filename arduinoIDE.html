    <h1>Arduino IDE<br>
    </h1>
    <p>In this unit we will be programming Arduino Uno devices using the
      Arduino IDE. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment.
      Although you can program these devices using other tools, we will
      use the official tool. Once you've mastered it, you are welcome to
      use other tools that you might prefer.<br>
    </p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId635864"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Download and Install the Arduino IDE</h2>
    <p><a href="https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.0-windows.exe">Download

        Arduino IDE 1.8.0</a> and then install it. You will need an
      administrator password to do so. You can use the default options.
      Once you've installed it, open it. You should see something like
      this:</p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="The Arduino IDE" title="The Arduino
        IDE" src="images/javaw_2016-12-27_10-40-05.png" height="685"
        width="600"><br>
      <div align="left">
        <p>This is the basic skeleton for an Arduino program. As you can
          see, there are two sections. The first is for code you only
          want to run when the Arduino boots up. The second is for the
          code you want to run as long as the Arduino is powered on.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId32734"></a>Checkpoint 2:
      Connect Your Arduino<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Go to the back of the classroom and get one USB A to USB B cable
      and one Arduino Uno. Do not use any Arduinos that have a label on
      them.</p>
    <p>Once you have them, quit the Arduino IDE and connect the Arduino
      Uno to your laptop using the cable. You should see a small green
      LED blink several times when you plug it in, and you'll see an
      orange LED as well.</p>
    <p>Open the Arduino IDE and go to the Tools menu. Hover your mouse
      over the Ports submenu and then choose the COM port that shows the
      Arduino Uno attached to it.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId643261"></a>Checkpoint 3: Edit
      Your Preferences<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Open Git Bash and navigate to your projects folder. Then use <code>git

        init</code> to create a repository called arduino.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Go to the File menu and open the editor preferences (you can also
      get here by pressing Ctrl+Comma). First, change the default
      location of your sketchbook to your new ~/projects/arduino folder.
      Then enable code folding and line numbers.</p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="The Arduino IDE preferences window"
        title="The Arduino IDE preferences window"
        src="images/javaw_2016-12-27_11-06-13.png" height="470"
        width="600"></div>
    <p>Once you've done this, press OK. Quit the Arduino IDE and reopen
      it.<br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId91058"></a>Checkpoint 4: Bare
      Minimum<br>
    </h2>
    <p>You should have the empty program on your screen. Go ahead and
      compile it by pressing the check symbol (or Ctrl+R) which will
      make sure your program is free of errors. This doesn't mean your
      program works, it just means that it doesn't have syntax errors.
      You should get a message similar to the following (I compiled and
      uploaded my program to a MEGA 2560, not an Uno) when it finishes
      in the console at the bottom of the window:</p>
    <p><samp>Sketch uses 656 bytes (0%) of program storage space.
        Maximum is 253952 bytes.<br>
        Global variables use 9 bytes (0%) of dynamic memory, leaving
        8183 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 8192 bytes.</samp><samp></samp><br>
    </p>
    <p>This just tells you how much of the Arduino's storage your
      program uses as well as how much memory it will use. Now, upload
      it to your Arduino. The Arduino won't do anything since it's an
      empty program, but you should get a simple message in the console
      telling you what happened:</p>
    <p><samp>Sketch uses 656 bytes (0%) of program storage space.
        Maximum is 253952 bytes.</samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>Global variables use 9 bytes (0%) of dynamic memory,
        leaving 8183 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 8192 bytes.</samp><br>
    </p>
    <p>It's basically the same. However, if you have any errors, those
      will also appear here. Go back to your settings and check the
      boxes for compilation and upload after the phrase: "Show verbose
      output during:" and repeat this checkpoint to see more detail
      about what's going on in the background.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, save your program as "bareMinimum" in your Arduino
      project folder. Then <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code>.
      Make sure your commit message follows the Seven Rules.<br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId675089"></a>Checkpoint 5: Git
      Remote<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Now you need to link your local Git repository to a remote
      repository on GitHub. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
      called "arduino". Make sure it is not capitalized.<br>
    </p>
    <div align="center"><img alt="Creating a new remote repository for
        your Arduino sketchbook" title="Creating a new remote repository
        for your Arduino sketchbook"
        src="images/chrome_2016-12-27_11-14-18.png" height="477"
        width="600"></div>
    <p>Then add this new remote repository to your local repository so
      that you can backup your work to GitHub. First, type the following
      command, replacing "username" with your GitHub user name:<br>
    </p>
    <p><code>git remote add origin git@github.com:username/arduino.git</code></p>
    <p>Then type:<br>
    </p>
    <p><code>git push -u origin master</code></p>
    <p>You should get a confirmation message, but if you get an error,
      be sure to read the instructions in the error message. You must
      understand that Git repositories can exist locally and remotely,
      and can be both at the same time. Almost all repositories in this
      class will be both local and remote since it allows you to have a
      backup of your work, but you can create a local repository which
      exists only on your computer if you want.<br>
