    <h1>Serial<br>
    </h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial">Your Arduino
        has a serial connection</a> for communicating with your computer
      or with other devices. Usually you'll use the built-in serial port
      in the USB port, but you can also connect to pins 0 and 1 to
      communicate over serial. Be careful when doing this since using
      the wrong voltages can damage your Arduino. During this lesson I
      link to several more detailed explanations of certain functions.
      If you're confused about what they do, try reading those before
      you ask a question.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId635864"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Connect Your Arduino<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Get your supplies and take out only the Arduino and the USB
      cable. Connect your Arduino to your laptop, open the Arduino IDE,
      and make sure the correct port is selected.<br>
    </p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId32734"></a>Checkpoint 2:
      Blink, But Better<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Create a new Arduino program from the file menu and write the
      code to make pin 13 blink on and off with a 1 second delay. Upload
      the program to make sure it works and then save the program as <i>serialBlink</i>
      in your <i>~/projects/arduino/</i> directory. Then add and commit
      it to version control using a proper commit message.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId643261"></a>Checkpoint 3: A
      Little Serial<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Now you need to add the following code to the <code>void setup()</code>
      function:</p>
    <p><samp>Serial.begin(9600);</samp></p>
    <img alt="" src="images/javaw_2017-01-10_11-30-58.png" height="786"
      width="800">
    <p>This activates the serial connection in your USB port and sets
      the baud rate to 9,600. <a
href="http://electronicdesign.com/communications/what-s-difference-between-bit-rate-and-baud-rate#4">This
        link provides a more detailed explanation of baud rates</a>, but
      it basically means the number of signals that can be sent per
      second. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Add the following code to the void loop() function right after
      the code that turns the LED on:</p>
    <p><samp>Serial.println("On");</samp></p>
    <p>Then add the following code to the void loop() function right
      after the code that turns the LED off:</p>
    <p><samp>Serial.println("Off");</samp><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/javaw_2017-01-10_11-42-46.png" height="786"
      width="800">
    <p>Upload the program to your Arduino and press the magnifying glass
      icon in the upper right corner to open your serial monitor. You
      should start to see a series of messages appear.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/2017-01-10_11-43-55.gif" height="453"
      width="800">
    <p>If you do, then save your program, add, and commit. If not, go
      back and review the instructions to make sure you've done the
      steps correctly.<br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId91058"></a>Checkpoint 4:
      Make Friends<br>
    </h2>
    Use the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Println">Serial.println()</a>
    functions to make your Arduino say something nice to the user when
    it first boots up. If it works, then save, add, and commit.<br>
    <p></p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId675089"></a>Checkpoint 5:
      Lines<br>
    </h2>
    Change all the Serial.println() functions to <a
      href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Print">Serial.print()</a>
    functions and see what happens in the serial monitor when you upload
    your program. What is the difference between println and print?<br>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId372063"></a>Checkpoint 6:
      You're in Charge<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Go ahead and change the Serial.print() functions back to
      Serial.println(). Now you're going to modify your program to turn
      the light on and off in response to commands you send via the
      serial monitor. First, add the following code underneath your
      friendly message:</p>
    <p><samp>Serial.println("Send 'On' to turn on the LED.");<br>
        Serial.println("Send 'Off' to turn off the LED.");</samp></p>
    <img alt="" src="images/javaw_2017-01-10_12-19-23.png" height="786"
      width="800">
    <p>Don't change anything else yet. Open your serial monitor and
      upload the program. As soon as the program uploads you should see
      something like this:</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/javaw_2017-01-10_12-20-47.png" height="453"
      width="800"><br>
    <p>If you see this, go ahead and save, add, and commit.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId574868"></a>Checkpoint 7: if /
      else<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Now you're going to create an <a
        href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Else">if / else</a>
      block in your <code>void loop()</code> function that will control
      the lights. An if / else block tells the Arduino to do one of the
      things in the block if certain conditions are met. If they're not
      met, the Arduino will simply loop around and try again. Add the
      following lines to your code:</p>
    <p><samp>if (Serial.readString() == "On") {</samp><samp></samp><samp></samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>&nbsp; digitalWrite(13, HIGH);</samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>}</samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>else if (Serial.readString() == "Off") {</samp><samp></samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>&nbsp; digitalWrite(13, LOW);</samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>}</samp><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/javaw_2017-01-10_12-27-14.png" height="786"
      width="800">
    <p>The <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/ReadString">Serial.readString()</a>
      function waits for you to send something from the computer to the
      Arduino via the serial connection and then reads it as if it is a
      group of text characters. If you were sending only integers or
      floating point values, you would use a different function. Open
      your serial monitor and then upload the code. You should now be
      able to type "On" or "Off" into the serial monitor to turn the
      light on and off. If it works, go ahead and save, add, and commit
      your code. However, you'll notice that it doesn't always respond.
      This is because we're directly reading the serial buffer, which is
      emptied every second. Sometimes it is emptied before the program
      has a chance to read it. We're going to fix this later.<br>
    </p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId651491"></a>Checkpoint 8:
      Feedback<br>
    </h2>
    Now that your light turns on and off, let's add some feedback for
    the user other than the light. Even though the light provides
    feedback, it's possible that the light could be defective. Having
    another way of knowing whether your code is working helps you to
    find problems with your software and hardware. I want you to add
    Serial.println() functions in your if / else block to tell you what
    the Arduino is doing in response to your commands.<br>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId397125"></a>Checkpoint 9:
      Nested Blocks<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Up until now, the Arduino has been unreliable in its response to
      our commands. We're going to fix that. At the beginning of your <code>void
        loop()</code> function, add the following:</p>
    <p><samp>if (Serial.available() &gt; 0) {</samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>&nbsp; String command;</samp><samp><br>
      </samp><samp>&nbsp; command = Serial.readString();</samp><samp><br>
      </samp></p>
    <p><samp>}</samp><samp></samp></p>
    <p>You'll notice that there is a blank line. In this blank line, cut
      and paste your if / else block and run <b>Auto Format</b>. Now
      you have if statements nested inside another if statement. The <a
        href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Serial/Available">Serial.available()</a>
      function checks to see if there is anything in the serial buffer.
      Once there is, it creates a string variable called command and
      then stores whatever is in the serial buffer as command.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/javaw_2017-01-10_15-05-36.png" height="1061"
      width="800">
    <p>Now, find the functions that turn the light on and off and change
      them so that they are triggered base on the command variable, not
      directly by the serial buffer.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Then add this command underneath your Serial.begin() function in
      your <code>void setup()</code> function:</p>
    <p><samp>Serial.setTimeout(10);</samp></p>
    <p>This will make your Arduino scan the serial buffer every ten
      milliseconds instead of once a second. Now test it and see if it
      does what you tell it to reliably. If it works, save, add, and
      commit your code.<br>
    </p>
    <p><i>If you want an extra challenge, see if you can get rid of the
        nested block. In other words, see if you can change the code so
        that you don't have an if inside another if. Also, see if you
        can add an else that responds to the user if they type anything
        except "On" or "Off" to help them figure out what to do.</i><br>
