    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId219582"></a> 화면
      캡쳐하기</h1>
    <p> 이 단원에서의 모든 과제들은 화면을 캡쳐하는 것 이므로, 신속하고 정확하게 하는 것이 중요합니다. 만약 맥 OS 사용자이실 경우, 여러분은 캡쳐를 위한 툴을 사용하실 수 있습니다. 
    또한 윈도우 사용자들께선 기존 캡쳐 툴이 다소 불편할 수 있으므로 ShareX를 다운받아주시길 바랍니다. 각자 자신의 운영체제에 맞는 섹션으로 가신 후 체크포인트들을 완성하십시오. 
      You'll have to take screenshots of your work throughout this course, so it's important to learn how to do it quickly and correctly.
       If you're using macOS, then you have some tools built in that we'll use. If you're using Windows, you need to install
      ShareX since the built-in Windows screenshot tools aren't quite good enough for what we need to do. Go to the section for your operating system and complete the checkpoints.</p>
