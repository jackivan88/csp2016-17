    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId219582"></a> Taking
      Screenshots</h1>
    <p> You'll have to take screenshots of your work throughout this
      course, so it's important to learn how to do it quickly and
      correctly. If you're using macOS, then you have some tools built
      in that we'll use. If you're using Windows, you need to install
      ShareX since the built-in Windows screenshot tools aren't quite
      good enough for what we need to do. Go to the section for your
      operating system and complete the checkpoints.</p>

    <p>Before you do anything else, <a
        href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361">read this
        article published by Apple that explains basic screenshot
        keyboard shortcuts</a>.</p>
    <p>Take a screenshot of your entire screen. Find the file on your
      desktop and rename it <code>takingScreenshotsCheckpoint1.png</code>
      and attach it to the Taking Screenshots assignment on Google
      Classroom.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Checkpoint 1: Raise your hand and have Mr.
      Olinda verify this checkpoint.</p>

    <p>If you installed the standard student software pack, you already
      have ShareX installed. If you removed it, you should reinstall the
      student software pack now.</p>
