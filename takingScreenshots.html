    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId219582"></a> Taking
      Screenshots</h1>
    <p> You'll have to take screenshots of your work throughout this course, so it's important to learn how to do it quickly and correctly. If you're using macOS, then you have some tools built in that we'll use. If you're using Windows, you need to install
      ShareX since the built-in Windows screenshot tools aren't quite good enough for what we need to do. Go to the section for your operating system and complete the checkpoints.</p>
