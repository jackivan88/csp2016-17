    <h1>Representing Information</h1>
    <p>Information can be represented in many ways. In this lesson we
      will work together as a class to learn the basics behind how
      computers use binary, store images, compress information, and
      detect errors. Then we will briefly study information theory.
      However, we will come back to study information theory in depth
      later in the unit.<br>
