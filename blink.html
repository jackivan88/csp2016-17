    <h1>Blink<br>
    </h1>
    <p>One of the advantages of programming with the Arduino platform is
      that you can often see immediate results from your code. We're
      going to create a program that causes LEDs to blink, both on the
      board itself and on a separate breadboard.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId635864"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Connect Your Arduino<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Get an Arduino from the table at the back of the room and a USB-A
      to USB-B cable. Connect it to your laptop and open the Arduino
      IDE. If it does not automatically open an empty sketch (program)
      then go to the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>New</b>. Make sure
      you have the correct port selected.<br>
    </p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId32734"></a>Checkpoint 2:
      Output Pin<br>
    </h2>
    <p>For the program to work, you need to designate one pin as an
      output pin. The Arduino Uno has a built-in LED attached to pin 13,
      which is what we will use for now. On line three of your empty
      program, press <b>Tab</b> and type:</p>
    <p><code>pinMode(13, OUTPUT);</code></p>
    <p>This tells the board to set pin 13 to output. Go to the <b>Tools</b>
      menu and choose <b>Auto Format</b>. Then verify your code to make
      sure you haven't made any syntax errors. At this point your code
      won't do anything, so do not upload it yet. Just save it as <i>blink</i>
      in your <i>~/projects/</i><i>arduino</i> folder. Then add and
      commit it to version control.<br>
    </p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId643261"></a>Checkpoint 3: High
      and Low<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Now let's add the code that will run continuously as long as your
      Arduino is powered on. Go to line eight and press <b>Tab</b>.
      Then type:</p>
    <p><code>digitalWrite(13, HIGH);</code></p>
    <p><code>delay(1000);</code></p>
    <p><code>digitalWrite(13, LOW);</code></p>
    <p><code>delay(1000);</code></p>
    <p>Go to the <b>Tools</b> menu and choose <b>Auto Format</b>. Then
      verify your code to make sure you haven't made any syntax errors.
      Save it, and then add and commit it to version control. Then
      upload it and see if the orange LED blinks on and off. If so,
      you've entered the code correctly. If not, go back and check each
      line.</p>
    <img alt="" src="images/javaw_2017-01-08_19-05-40.png" height="763"

    <p>What part or parts of your code do you think turns on the light?
      What part or parts turns it off? What part or parts control the
      duration of the blink? What unit do you think is used to measure
      time?<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId91058"></a>Checkpoint 4:
      Timing<br>
    </h2>
    The way your program works right now, your LED is on for one second
    and off for one second. Modify it so that it is on for one second
    and off for two. The amount of time an LED is on during one cycle is
    called the duty cycle. So a duty cycle of 50% means that the light
    is on half the duration of a cycle. Try at least three other
    combinations of timings. Be prepared to demonstrate changing the
    timings for Mr. Olinda and express them both in seconds as well as
    duty cycles. <br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId675089"></a>Checkpoint 5:
      Patterns<br>
    </h2>
    Now that you know how to adjust the timing of the lights, add extra
    lines of code to turn the light on and off in different patterns.
    You must create a pattern that uses at least four ON/OFF pairs, and
    each pair must be different.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId372063"></a>Checkpoint 6:
      Commenting Your Code</h2>
    <p>Go ahead and add comments on each line of code, explaining what
      you think each line does. Comments are preceded by <code>//</code>
      so that the compiler knows they're not supposed to be code. You
      can add comments after code or on their own lines.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <p>Checkpoint 7: External LED Setup</p>
    <p>Now we are going to modify the program to turn an external LED on
      and off. Go to the supply bin and get a breadboard, two wires, a
      1K resistor (black, red, and gold stripes), and a red LED.
      Breadboards are small, rectangular pieces of plastic with holes in
      them where you can quickly add and remove wires and other parts to
      try out different circuits. The wires will carry the current from
      the board to the LED, and the resistor simply protects the LED
      from overheating.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Then, unplug and set up your Arduino to match the diagram below.
      Make sure you use exactly the same pins as the diagram. Notice
      that one of the pins on the LED is longer. That pin is bent in the
      diagram.<br>
    </p>

      External LED Setup" src="images/External%20LED_blink.gif"
      height="586" width="800"><br>
    <p>If you plug your Arduino back in, you'll notice it does not do
      anything new. Go ahead and edit your code to make the external LED
      blink. Once it does, save your code, and add and commit it to
      version control.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId651491"></a>Checkpoint 8:
      Clean</h2>
    <p>Get a resealable bag from the back table and write your name on
      it in permanent marker. Then place your Arduino, USB cable,
      breadboard, wires, resistor, and LED inside and place the bag on
      the back table.</p>
    <p>Then push your finished code to your remote repository.</p>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId151306"></a>Checkpoint 9:
      Write</h2>
    <p>Write a short blog post summarizing what you accomplished today.
      At the end, write some ideas that you would like to try with your
      Arduino. Your post should be two paragraphs, three to five
      sentences each.</p>
