    <h1>Computer Hardware<br>
    </h1>
    All computers rely on some sort of hardware in order to run programs
    and operating systems. This lesson will give you a basic
    understanding of the parts and interfaces that your computer has.
    You will also get to practice disassembling and assembling
    computers. We will not cover all possible parts in this lesson since
    you will learn more specific things naturally as we go through the
    course.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId617366"></a>Input Devices<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Personal computers usually have at least one way to get
      information from the user to the machine. On your laptop, you
      probably use two all the time, although there are more that we
      can't cover in this lesson.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId735457"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Keyboards</h3>
    <p>This is probably the one you use the most. The keyboard allows
      the user to send information to the computer using electrical
      signals. Most laptop keyboards use a butterfly mechanism which
      takes up little space but can feel "mushy" when pressed. Larger
      keyboards often use rubber membranes inside to make the keys
      springy. These tend to be thicker than laptop keyboards. Some
      large keyboards are mechanical, meaning there is a vertical switch
      that is activated by pressing down on them. These mechanical
      keyboards tend to be very loud, but are easier to type on.</p>
    <p>Keyboards also come in different layouts and languages. The most
      common keyboard layout for English users is QWERTY. Why do you
      think this layout is called QWERTY?</p>
    <p><img alt="This is one type of QWERTY keyboard." title="This is
        one type of QWERTY keyboard."

        height="254" width="800"></p>
    <p>Many computers, like ours here in Korea, come with bilingual
      keyboards. Some keyboards have a number pad while others do not.
      There are also different layouts like DVORAK.</p>
    <img alt="This is a DVORAK keyboard layout." title="This is a DVORAK

      height="241" width="800">
    <p>Find out how to set up your keyboard layout and language for your
      operating system. What language and layout does your computer use
      by default? Be as specific as possible.<br>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId9807"></a>Checkpoint 2: Mice,
      Pens, and Touchpads<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Early personal computers had only a keyboard. Eventually the
      mouse was developed to allow the user to interact with graphical
      user interfaces more naturally. Many people consider the mouse to
      be an improvement over keyboard-only interaction, although it did
      make operating systems much more complex. The first mice had
      wheels on the bottom. Then mice had a ball on the bottom which was
      easier to move. Most mice today use an optical sensor that doesn't
      move to track the motion of the mouse.<br>
    </p>

      allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" width="800"></iframe>
    <p>Some early computers and many modern ones also allow the user to
      interact with the computer using a pen or stylus. One of the
      earliest examples of pen input on a computer was the Elliot Light
      Pen. Pens were very familiar for users and are still very popular
      with artists and engineers for communicating information with
      computers.</p>

      allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" width="800"></iframe>
    <p>Most laptops feature a touchpad (which is also called a trackpad)
      which is more compact than a mouse and can fit more easily into
      the flat shape of a laptop. Touchpads have become more
      sophisticated over time and now allow multi-touch, gestures, and
      even offer haptic feedback.</p>
    <p>Be prepared to answer the following questions:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>When was the first computer mouse invented?</li>
      <li>Who invented the computer mouse?</li>
      <li>What form of input is popular with designers and artists?<br>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId123155"></a>Checkpoint 3:
      Microphone</h3>
    <p>Many laptops and tablets have microphones, and some desktops have
      them as well. In the past, these were usually used to send audio
      information to the computer for recording or sending to another
      person. However, more and more computers allow you to interact
      with the computer itself using audio. This is especially important
      if you aren't able to use more traditional forms of input because
      of a physical disability. Take one of the class tablets from the
      equipment shelves and figure out how to input information using
      your voice. You should start out by going to the tablet's settings
      and enabling speech input.<br>
    </p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId447248"></a>Checkpoint 4:
      Camera<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Like microphones, most computers used cameras to store
      information or send information to other users. However, computers
      are able to use cameras for user interaction as well. Windows 10
      allows users to login by looking at the webcam to verify their
      identity, and there are applications that allow users to gesture
      to their computer's camera to perform different tasks. Give me an
      example of a way you could, or wish you could, interact with your
      computer using the camera.<br>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId594695"></a>Checkpoint 5:
      Touchscreens</h3>
    <p>Because smartphones and tablets are so common now, we are used to
      touchscreens as a form of user input. Touchscreens have existed
      for many years, but they've become more sophisticated.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The first touchscreens were resistive. They worked by sensing
      electrical signals generated by pressing the outer layer of the
      screen against the inner layer, which completed a circuit.</p>
    <img alt=""

      <li>Empty space</li>
      <li>Glass</li>
      <li>LCD</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Resistive screens are not very precise without some sort of
      stylus, although they're still used in situations where the user
      would wear thick gloves since they don't need an electrical
      current from the user's finger to sense touch Capacitive screens
      use the electrical field of your skin to tell where you are
      pressing on the screen. If you hold a smartphone or tablet up to
      bright light at an angle, you can usually see a grid of lines or
      dots. Each of these sensors measures electrical fields. The
      stronger the field, the more likely it is that you're touching
      that part of the screen. However, these screens do not work as
      well with gloves, and they do not work underwater.</p>
    <p>Get your PocketCHIP as well as one of the tablets. Determine what
      type of touchscreen each one has by testing them with different
      objects.</p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId388771"></a>Checkpoint 6:
      Motion Control</h3>
    <iframe
src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_d6KuiuteIA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0"
      allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" width="800"></iframe>
    <p>This form of input is becoming more common as virtual reality
      systems mature. You're probably most familiar with motion control
      from systems like the Nintendo Wii or smartphones and tablets.
      However, laptops and desktops can also use these forms of input.
      What kind of job or task would be easier to do with motion control
      than with one of the other forms of input?<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId944648"></a>Output Devices</h2>
    <p>Computers must be able to accept input from users, but it's just
      as important for them to be able to get information back to the
      user. We're going to cover the most common methods.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId109641"></a>Checkpoint 7:
      Screens</h3>
    <p>Believe it or not, the first computers had neither screens nor
      keyboards. You got information in and out using switches, punch
      cards, or printouts. Screens allowed the computer to display
      information and update it quickly for the user. This made working
      with text and images much easier since the user could see their
      changes live instead of waiting for the machine to print out the
      work.</p>
    <p>Screens were first based on cathode-ray tubes which charged the
      surface of the screen, causing phosphors in the screen to glow
      based on electrical current. The screen used a large magnet in the
      back of the screen to aim the charging beam, moving rapidly from
      one side to the other, top to bottom.</p>
    <p>Liquid crystal displays use a layer of crystals suspended in
      fluid that rotate based on charge. Each pixel contains several
      crystals which can be rotated independently, allowing various
      amounts of light and color through from the light behind the
      screen. A more modern form of screen is the organic light emitting
      diode, which allows the pixels to produce the light, instead of
      simply allowing it through the screen.</p>
    <p>What type of screen does your computer use?<br>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId615012"></a>Checkpoint 8:
      Speakers</h3>
    <p>Computers can use sound to transmit information to the user. We
      usually use this to listen to music or videos, but computers also
      use sound to communicate information to the user about the
      computer itself. See if you can get your computer to respond to
      your input using sound. For example, computers often warn the user
      of an error using sound.<br>

    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId574830"></a>Checkpoint 9:
      Haptics</h3>
    <p>Some computers and tablets and almost all phones use some sort of
      haptic feedback, such as vibration, to communicate information to
      the user. For example, your phone can vibrate continuously to let
      you know you have a phone call, vibrate in pulses for text
      messages, and vibrate once for a Facebook notification. What is a
      way your computer could use haptic feedback to communicate with
      you? What are the advantages of haptic feedback instead of audio
      or visual feedback?<br>

    </h2>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId573978"></a>Checkpoint 10:
      Power<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Most computers, especially desktops, don't send data through the
      same port they use for power (unlike phones). This port allows the
      computer to draw power from another source to either run the
      computer, charge the battery, or both. There are some universal
      shapes and sizes of ports, although some laptops have ports that
      are unique to prevent them from being used with other chargers or
      cables.</p>
    <p>Where is the power port on your computer? Take a close look at it
      and see what it looks like on the inside. See if you can find a
      laptop in the room that has a different type of power port than
      your computer.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="checkpoint">Raise your hand and have Mr. Olinda verify
      this checkpoint.</p>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId824473"></a>Checkpoint 11: USB</h3>
    <p>USB stands for universal serial bus. Most computers, tablets, and
      phones use USB ports to receive and send information to other
      devices. There are five major types of USB ports you will see on a
      regular basis. I've organized them based on physical appearance,
      not speed. Unfortunately the classification of USB types is very
      confusing, and you can refer to a full list here if you want more
      specific information. The letter usually refers to the shape of
      the connector, while the number refers to the speed.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>USB A</b> is the connector you see on most computers. It is
      rectangular and one half contains a plastic tab. This connector
      has been used with USB 1, 2, and 3, and all three are
      cross-compatible, although they'll only work at the speed of the
      slowest part, whether that is the port or the cable.</p>
    <p><b>USB B</b> is often used on printers, scanners, and other
      accessories. It is square and hollow on the inside. You'll also
      see it on the Arduino units we work with later this year. USB B
      also has been used with USB 1, 2, and 3, but most cables with USB
      B are USB A on the other end.<br>
