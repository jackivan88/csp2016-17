    <h1>Computer Hardware<br>
    </h1>
    All computers rely on some sort of hardware in order to run programs
    and operating systems. This lesson will give you a basic
    understanding of the parts and interfaces that your computer has.
    You will also get to practice disassembling and assembling
    computers. We will not cover all possible parts in this lesson since
    you will learn more specific things naturally as we go through the
    course.<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId617366"></a>Input Devices<br>
    </h2>
    <p>Personal computers usually have at least one way to get
      information from the user to the machine. On your laptop, you
      probably use two all the time, although there are more that we
      can't cover in this lesson.</p>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId735457"></a>Checkpoint 1:
      Keyboards</h3>
    <p>This is probably the one you use the most. The keyboard allows
      the user to send information to the computer using electrical
      signals. Most laptop keyboards use a butterfly mechanism which
      takes up little space but can feel "mushy" when pressed. Larger
      keyboards often use rubber membranes inside to make the keys
      springy. These tend to be thicker than laptop keyboards. Some
      large keyboards are mechanical, meaning there is a vertical switch
      that is activated by pressing down on them. These mechanical
      keyboards tend to be very loud, but are easier to type on.</p>
    <p>Keyboards also come in different layouts and languages. The most
      common keyboard layout for English users is QWERTY. Why do you
      think this layout is called QWERTY?</p>
    <p><img alt="This is one type of QWERTY keyboard." title="This is
        one type of QWERTY keyboard."

        height="254" width="800"></p>
    <p>Many computers, like ours here in Korea, come with bilingual
      keyboards. Some keyboards have a number pad while others do not.
      There are also different layouts like DVORAK.</p>

      height="241" width="800">
    <p>Find out how to set up your keyboard layout and language for your
      operating system. What language and layout does your computer use
      by default? Be as specific as possible.<br>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId9807"></a>Checkpoint 2: Mice,
      Pens, and Touchpads<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Early personal computers had only a keyboard. Eventually the
      mouse was developed to allow the user to interact with graphical
      user interfaces more naturally. Many people consider the mouse to
      be an improvement over keyboard-only interaction, although it did
      make operating systems much more complex. The first mice had
      wheels on the bottom. Then mice had a ball on the bottom which was
      easier to move. Most mice today use an optical sensor that doesn't
      move to track the motion of the mouse.<br>
    </p>

      allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="450" width="800"></iframe>
    <p>Some early computers and many modern ones also allow the user to
      interact with the computer using a pen or stylus. One of the
      earliest examples of pen input on a computer was the Elliot Light
      Pen. Pens were very familiar for users and are still very popular
      with artists and engineers for communicating information with
      computers.</p>

    <p>Most laptops feature a touchpad (which is also called a trackpad)
      which is more compact than a mouse and can fit more easily into
      the flat shape of a laptop. Touchpads have become more
      sophisticated over time and now allow multi-touch, gestures, and
      even offer haptic feedback.</p>
    <p>Be prepared to answer the following questions:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>When was the first computer mouse invented?</li>
      <li>Who invented the computer mouse?</li>
      <li>What form of input is popular with designers and artists?<br>

    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId123155"></a>Checkpoint 3:
      Microphone</h3>
    <p>Many laptops and tablets have microphones, and some desktops have
      them as well. In the past, these were usually used to send audio
      information to the computer for recording or sending to another
      person. However, more and more computers allow you to interact
      with the computer itself using audio. Take one of the class
      tablets from the equipment shelves and figure out how to input
      information using your voice.<br>

      Motion Control</h3>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>This form of input is becoming more common as virtual reality
      systems mature. You're probably most familiar with motion control
      from systems like the Nintendo Wii or smartphones and tablets.
      However, laptops and desktops can also use these forms of input.
      What kind of job or task would be easier to do with motion control
      than with one of the other forms of input?<br>

    <h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId944648"></a>Output Devices</h2>
    <p>Computers must be able to accept input from users, but it's just
      as important for them to be able to get information back to the
      user.<br>

    </h2>
    <h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId573978"></a>Checkpoint 9:
      Power<br>
    </h3>
    <p>Most computers, especially desktops, don't send data through the
      same port they use for power (unlike phones). This port allows the
      computer to draw power from another source to either run the
      computer, charge the battery, or both. There are some universal
      shapes and sizes of ports, although some laptops have ports that
      are unique to prevent them from being used with other chargers or
      cables.</p>
    <p>Where is the power port on your computer? Take a close look at it
      and see what it looks like on the inside. See if you can find a
      laptop in the room that has a different type of power port than
      your computer.<br>
