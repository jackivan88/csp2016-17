    <h1>Touch Typing<br>
    </h1>
    <p>Previous lessons have been based on checkpoints. This lesson will
      be completed using Google Classroom.</p>
    <h2>Create An Account</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.typing.com/student/join#562715BFCCBAC">Go to
        typing.com</a> and sign in with your school Google account. You
      will be added to my class automatically. Please raise your hand if
      you cannot complete the signup process.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Complete J, F, and Space</h2>
    <p>Start working on the first lesson right now. It's extremely
      important that you position your hands exactly as described in the
      lessons. Do not look at your hands as you type (even if this slows
      you down) so that you can learn to type without looking at the
      keyboard.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Once you finish you will see a screen telling you that you've
      completed the lesson. Screenshot this and attach it to the
      "Complete J, F, and Space" Classroom Assignment. If you don't
      complete it in class, it becomes homework. Future typing lessons
      will be assigned via Classroom. If you want to work ahead, you
      may.<br>
